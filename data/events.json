This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanized factory system. Output greatly increased, and a result was an unprecedented rise in population and in the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods, and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"

Fighting began on April 19, 1775 at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The war was formalized and intensified following passage of the Lee Resolution, which asserted that the Thirteen Colonies were \"free and independent states\", and the Declaration of Independence, drafted by the Committee of Five and written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 2, 1776 and July 4, 1776, respectively. In the war, American patriot forces were supported by the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain. The British, in turn, were supported by Hessian soldiers from present-day Germany, most Native Americans, Loyalists, and freedmen. The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. The American War of Independence led to an increase in the production of weapons and ammunition, requiring the use of more fossil fuels and contributing to an increase in CO2 emissions.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"

It was marked by the rise of the oil industry and the increasing use of oil as an energy source. In 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the first commercially viable oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, which led to increasing oil production in the United States. With the discovery of new oil fields and the growing demand for this resource, the oil industry became one of the most important sectors of the global economy. This revolution had a major impact on the economy, politics, and society in general. It also led to geopolitical conflicts over control of oil reserves in different regions of the world. Today, oil is a vital energy source for the global economy, but it also has a negative impact on the environment due to its greenhouse gas emissions.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"

The starting point of the Industrial Revolution in China was the region of Shanghai and the Yangtze River Valley in eastern China. The Qing government, which was in power in China at the time, was forced to sign unequal treaties with Western powers following the Opium War, which led to the opening of Chinese ports for trade with Western countries. This stimulated industrialization in China, as many foreign entrepreneurs invested in manufacturing industries such as textiles, machinery, steel, and shipbuilding. Industrialization was also encouraged by the Qing government, which created state-owned enterprises to produce modern manufactured goods and encouraged local entrepreneurs to establish factories.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_and_industrial_history_of_China\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders. The Second World War had a significant impact on CO2 emissions worldwide, largely due to the increase in industrial production and the increased use of fossil fuels to power the war industries. However, despite this increase in fossil fuel production and consumption, CO2 emissions actually decreased during the war, particularly in the war-torn countries of Europe. This reduction was caused by the decrease in industrial production in the war zones and the reduction in travel and transportation.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"

The embargo was targeted at nations that had supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The initial nations targeted were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, though the embargo also later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen nearly 300%, from US $3 per barrel ($19/m3) to nearly $12 per barrel ($75/m3) globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or \"shock\", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was later called the \"first oil shock\", followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the \"second oil shock\". The oil shocks of the 1970s led to a temporary reduction in CO2 emissions due to a decrease in oil consumption, but emissions quickly resumed their upward trend.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis\" target=\"_blank\">Discover</a>"
